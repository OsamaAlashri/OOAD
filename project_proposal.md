# Project Proposal: Task Management System

## Problem Description
In modern workplaces, managing and tracking tasks is often disorganized, leading to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and reduced productivity. Employees struggle to stay updated on assigned tasks, managers find it challenging to monitor progress, and critical deadlines are missed. The **Task Management System** aims to streamline the task management process by providing a centralized platform for creating, assigning, tracking, and reporting on tasks. This system enhances collaboration and accountability, ensuring tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.
